This is a chess platform, built for two-player mode. This is coded in HTML, CSS & Javascript. 

To Open it, follow these steps:

1) Extract all the files (through zip mode etc)
2) Go to the file "index.html"
3) Open it on any browser, the opened page will be the Home Page of website

4) To start a match between two players;
   a) go to the "QuickMatch" option on the sidebar.
   b) Enter the names of players, playing with the White & Black Pieces
   c) Select the desired time format, like bullet, blitz or rapid, and start the game
   d) Whosoever runs out of time loses.
   e) There is an option for resign as well.
   f) I had hard-coded for checkmate function as well, but unfortunately, it is too difficult to be debugged by me, who is more or less a beginner in dev
   
5) There is an option for different variants as well like:
  a) Fischer Random Chess : The positions of all the back-rank pieces are shuffled, which makes it different from the trivial chess.
  b) All-Pawns: All the pieces are replaces by pawns, and whosoever lasts with a pawn standing wins.
  c) All-Knights: same as above, but pieces are replaced by knights.

6) You can change the background of the entire website in the Settings section on the sidebar.
7) There is a section of Opening-Explorer too. A chess-beginner can go and learn any opening he wants. I have used the links of lichess here.
8) One can go and use some useful sites for learning chess, in the Partners section on the top bar.


Last Note: I have made this website to help the beginners who are new to chess, and aspire to learn the secrets behind this marvellous game, by using various resources the world has for them to offer.
I have kept in mind the struggles and obstacles I faced when I was learning chess. So a beginner will definitely find it helpful. As I already said, I am new to Dev, it is my first project at this scale. 
I have tried my best to code a complex game like chess myself. There are hundreds of source codes available for it, but i thought and coded all of it myself (obviously took help from various resources to 
implement JavaScript). I don't hesitate to say that, there are still a few functionalities left which are yet to be coded (like checkmate, en-passant), but i need to enrich my skillset more for that.

I hope the judges will like my work, and appreciate my efforts.
